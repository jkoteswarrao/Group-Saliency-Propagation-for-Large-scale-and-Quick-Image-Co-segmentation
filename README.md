# Group-Saliency-Propagation-for-Large-scale-and-Quick-Image-Co-segmentation
A co-segmentation method that appears in ICIP'15 
Following are the instructions for running the code:

Run compile.m [NOTE: Pls comment line 5 of project.h in mexDenseSIFT and SiftFlow folders if you are compiling using visual studio in windows, and uncomment if you are in linux or mac os.] 
Run main.m for demo


If you find the code useful, kindly cite the following papers:
